Summary
=======

Riven X is the rebirth of the best episode in the MYST™ saga for Mac OS X. The same content, the same wonder, a brand-new engine. Although Riven™ was released in 1997 for both Mac OS and Windows, it was never updated to be a native Mac OS X application. With Intel Macs becoming dominant meaning the loss of the Classic environment, something had to be done in order for future generations of Mac users to enjoy Riven™. Thanks to the work of dedicated individuals, in particular Tito Dal Canton, the Riven™ data files were reversed engineered, thus paving the way for a new engine.

Legal
=====

Riven X contains no copyrighted material from the original game with the exception of localized Extras.MHK archives (because extraction of that file from the original CD edition’s VISE installer is not possible). Reverse engineering was performed to decipher the Riven™ archive files and the Riven™ data files contained therein, but such reverse engineering was not performed with the intent of distributing copyrighted content or otherwise circumventing digital rights management technology. Riven X requires a legal copy of Riven™ to play.
